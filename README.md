# Python Notebooks

I created these Jupyter Notebooks as a part of my summer appointment to teach the students of a Finance Club at B-School. The goal of these sessions was to help the students with little or limited knowledge of Python to learn the programming language. They would be able to work with financial datasets, and make some meaning out of them.

I created this content with the help of several tutorials that I participated in and I also referred a lot to Python Documentations.

The content of these files include:
* Data Types and Operations
* How to write Functions
* Data Structures (Lists, Tuples, Dictionary, Sets)
* List Comprehension and Lambda Functions
* Numpy Package
* Pandas Package
* Matplotlib Package
* How to download financial data from Yahoo Finance and perform statistical analysis
